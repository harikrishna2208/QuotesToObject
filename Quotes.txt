"While I was in Ann Arbor I heard that Boston was a good place to
play acoustic music because they still had plenty of clubs.  So I
moved to Cambridge.  I roomed with a Harvard student.  I got an
apartment the first day I got to town by going to Harvard
housing, so I could get cheaper rates, $80 a month or something. 
I even went to some Harvard classes, just to sit in, because I
enjoyed the performance of the professors.  The teachers were
always so theatrical at Harvard, intelligent show business
people, that could keep your attention, and that I think, is the
great advantage of Harvard.  So I used to go for the show, no
matter what subject it was.  You could just drop in to a class
and watch, it wouldn't matter if you went to the school.  No one
even asked.  The show was good and you would learn something, but
you wouldn't get any credit for it.  I didn't need the credit."

"He loved to ask his mother questions.  It was the pleasantest
thing for him to ask a question and then to hear what answer his
mother would give.  Bambi was never surprised that question after
question should come into his mind continually and without
effort.  He found it perfectly natural, and it delighted him very
much.  It was very delightful too, to wait expectantly till the
answer came.  If it turned out the way he wanted, he was
satisfied.  Sometimes, of course, he did not understand, but that
was pleasant also because he was kept busy picturing what he had
not understood, in his own way.  Sometimes he felt very sure that
his mother was not giving him a complete answer, was
intentionally not telling him all she knew.  And, at first, that
was very pleasant, too.  For then there would remain in him such
a lively curiosity, such suspicion, mysteriously and joyously
flashing through him, such anticipation, that he would become
anxious and happy at the same time, and grow silent."  (Bambi 20-

once heard a story about a monastery on the top of some mountain
in Japan or somewhere.  After a long trek in the cold to get
there, the monks would offer to sell you a cup of coffee.  You
had a choice:  There was a two-dollar cup -- or a two-hundred-

were reported to say, 'A hundred and ninety-eight dollars.'" (The

to open his door when he come down that path with the full red
gasoline can in his right hand -- she looked like a girl of no
more than sixteen, a girl on her learner's permit, and her beauty
was terrible, but I believe it would no longer kill the man it
turned itself on; for a moment her eyes lit on me, I was not

creatures and biomechanics.  And I love to work with bones --
they are elemental and function and, after all, are part of human

had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
things, all because they would not remember the simple rules
their friends had taught them:  that a red-hot poker will burn
you if you hold it too long, and that if you cut your finger very

that takes away the negative edge through a positive counter-
response.  This way, you reinforce and reaffirm your conviction
in the inner values.  You harness those beliefs and develop them

are few things more beloved of our masses than the figure of the
cultural rebel, the defiant individualist resisting the mandates

in a mowhawk and multiple-pierced ears, a policeman who plays by
his own rules, an actor on a motorcycle, a soldier of fortune
with explosive bow and arrow, or a rock star in leather jacket

Stories, novels, whatever... reflect something about the
writer... and the culture... and the society that it came from. 
It's a mirror -- a mirror to ourselves.  And when we do it right,
when we just get it, we know something about ourselves.  English
is an understanding of the self.  If we can see ourselves

"Let me tell you something.  We're all guilty of something. 
Cruelty or greed or going sixty-five in a fifty-five mile per
hour zone.  But you know what?  You want to think of yourself as
the fair haired choir boy, you go ahead. ... I'm saying you've
got a darkness inside of you.  You've got to know the darker,
uglier sides of yourself.  You've got to recognize them so
they're not constantly sneaking up on you.  You've got to love
them because they're a part of you, because along with your
virtues, they make you who you are.  Virtue isn't virtue unless
it slams up against vice so, consequently, your virtue is not
real virtue until it's been tested... and tempted."

"A soulmate is someone who has locks that fit our keys, and keys
to fit our locks.  When we feel safe enough to open the locks,
our truest selves step out and we can be completely and honestly
who we are; we can be loved for who we are and not for who we're
pretending to be.  Each unveils the best part of the other.  No
matter what else goes wrong around us, with that one person we're
safe in our own paradise.  Our soulmate is someone who shares our
deepest longings, our sense of direction.  When we're two
balloons, and together our direction is up, chances are we've
found the right person.  Our soulmate is the one who makes life
come to life." (Bridge 265)

I'd suggest you want to find your soulmate, soon as you can.

Could it be it's not as important to be alike as it is to be
curious?  Because we're different, we can have the fun of

the beginning.  I think it would go on for us as long as we

can be infinity!  But so often one person drags the other down;
one person wants to go up like a balloon and the other's a dead

people, if a woman and a man both wanted to go up like balloons!"

think they're going to get these things if they touch you.  It's
scary, so you build walls around yourself, thick glass walls
while you're trying to think, trying to catch your breath.  You
know who you are inside, but people outside see something
different.  You can choose to become the image, and let go of who
you are, or continue as you are and feel phony when you play the

are threads that intend to bring you back.  Mind turns to pull,
it's hard to pull away.  I'm always thinking of going back.  When
Lot's wife looked over her shoulder, she turned into a pillar of
salt.  Pillars hold things up, and salt keeps things clean, but
it's a poor exchange for losing your self.  People do go back,
but they don't survive, because two realities are claiming them
at the same time.  Such things are too much.  You can salt your
heart, or kill your heart, or you can choose between the two
realities.  There is much pain here.  Some people think you can
have your cake and eat it.  The cake goes mouldy and they choke
on what's left.  Going back after a long time will make you mad,
because the people you left behind do not like to think of you
changed, will treat you as they always did, accuse you of being
indifferent, when you are only different."

"Of course that is not the whole story, but that is the way with
stories; we make them what we will.  It's a way of explaining the
universe while leaving the universe unexplained, it's a way of
keeping it all alive, not boxing it into time.  Everyone who
tells a story tells it differently, just to remind us that
everybody sees it differently.  Some people say there are true
things to be found, some people say all kinds of things can be
proved.  I don't believe them.  The only thing for certain is how
complicated it all is, like string full of knots.  It's all there
but hard to find the beginning and impossible to fathom the end. 
The best you can do is admire the cat's cradle, and maybe knot it
up a bit more.  History should be a hammock for swinging and a
game for playing, the way cats play.  Claw it, chew it, rearrange
it and at bedtime it's still a ball of string full of knots. 
Nobody should mind.  Some people make a lot of money out of it. 
Publishers do well, people make a lot of money out of it. 
Publishers do well, children, when bright, can come top.  It's an

lines, like a larger version of our church.  Now I was finding
that even the church was sometimes confused.  This was a problem. 
But not one I chose to deal with for many years more.  The
problem there and then was what was going to happen to me.  The
Victoria Hospital was big and frightening, and I couldn't even
sing to any effect because I couldn't hear what I was singing. 
There was nothing to read except some dental notices and an
instruction leaflet for the X-ray machine.  I tried to build an
igloo out of the orange peel but it kept falling down and even
when I stood up I didn't have an Eskimo to put in it, so I had to
invent a story about 'How Eskimo Got Eaten', which made me even
more miserable.  It's always the same with diversions; you get

meant whatever it meant for you and as soon as you see the

"The music of [his] Fifth Concerto streamed from his keyboard,
past the glass of the window, and spread through the air, over
the lights of the valley.  It was a symphony of triumph.  The
notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising
itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they
seemed to embody every human act and thought  that had ascent as
its motive.  It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding
and spreading open.  It had the freedom of release and the
tension of purpose.  It swept space clean and left nothing buy
the joy of an unobstructed effort.  Only a faint echo within the
sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped, bu spoke
in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no
ugliness or pain, and there never had had to be.  It was the song
of an immense deliverance."  (Atlas 1072)

"To be under pressure is inescapable.  Pressure takes place
through all the world; war, siege, the worries of state.  We all
know men who grumble under these pressures and complain.  They
are cowards.  They lack splendour.  But there is another sort of
man who is under the same pressure but does not complain, for it
is the friction which polishes him.  It is the pressure which
refines and makes him noble."

"It is not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how
the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have
done better.  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in
the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat; who strives
valiantly; who errs and may fail again, because there is no
effort without error or shortcoming, but who does actually strive
to do the deeds; who does know the great enthusiasm, the great
devotion; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best,
knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at
worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that
his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know
neither victory nor defeat."

"When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means
the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of
giving much advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to
share our pain and touch our wounds with a gentle and tender
hand.  The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of
despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief
and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not
healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that
is a friend who cares."

"Sometimes when I generalize I am saying, 'Let's pretend I am

"Within me is the potential to commit every evil act I see being
committed by other men, and unless I feel this potential I can at
any moment be controlled by these same urges.  I am free from
these urges only if I recognize when I am feeling them, and while

parts of me.  And only in this way can I know what it is I am

"I sometimes react to making a mistake as if I have betrayed
myself.  My fear of making a mistake seems to be based on the
hidden assumption that I am potentially perfect and that if I can
just be very careful I will not fall from heaven.  But a
'mistake' is a declaration of the way I am, a jolt to the way I
intend, a reminder I am not dealing with the facts.  When I have
listened to my mistakes I have grown." (Notes)

"Perfectionism is a slow death.  If everything were to just like

experience something unexpected." (Notes)

"I can not 'make my mark' for all time -- those concepts are
mutually exclusive.  'Lasting effect' is a self-contradictory
term.  Meaning does not exist in the future and neither do I. 
Nothing will have meaning 'ultimately.'  Nothing will even mean
tomorrow what it did today.  Meaning changes with the context. 
My meaningfulness is here.  It is enough that I am of value to
someone today.  It is enough that I make a difference now."

"I think that you appreciate that there are extraordinary men and
women, and extraordinary moments when history leaps forward on
the backs of these individuals.  That what can be imagined, can
be achieved.  That you must dare to dream, but that there is no
substitute for perseverance and hard work, and team work, because
no one gets there alone.  And that while we commemorate the
greatness of these events and the individuals who achieve them,
we cannot forget the sacrifice of those who makes these
achievements and leaps possible."

"The fact is that liberty, in any true sense, is a concept that
lies quite beyond the reach of the inferior man's mind.  And no
wonder, for genuine liberty demands of its votaries a quality he
lacks completely, and that is courage.  The man who loves it must
be willing to fight for it; blood, said Jefferson, is its natural
manure.  Liberty means self-reliance, it means resolution, it
means the capacity for doing without... the average man doesn't
want to be free.  He wants to be safe."

"There's an element of contempt for meanings.  You want to write
outside the usual framework.  You want to dare readers to make a

prose].  There's also the sense of drowning in information and in
the mass awareness of things.  Everybody seems to know
everything.  Subjects surface and are totally exhausted in a
matter of days. ... The writer is driven by his conviction that
some truths aren't arrived at so easily, that life is still full
of mystery, that it might be better for you, dear reader, if you
went back to the living section of your newspaper because this is
the dying section and you don't really want to be here.  This

world, we try to devise a shape, a plan.  There is dignity in
this.  Your whole life is a plot, a scheme, a diagram.  It is a
failed scheme but that's not the point.  To plot is to affirm
life, to seek shape and control.  Even after death, most
particularly after death, the search continues.  Burial rites are
an attempt to complete the scheme, in ritual.  Picture a state
funeral.  It is all precision, detail, order, design.  The nation
holds its breath.  The efforts of a huge and powerful government
are brought to bear on a ceremony that will shed the last trace
of chaos.  If all geos well, if they bring it off, some natural
law of perfection is obeyed.  The nation is delivered from
anxiety, the deceased's life is redeemed, life itself is
strengthened, reaffirmed."  (Noise)

But as we all know, endings are just beginnings.  You know, once

again.  However, as we have all come this far, I think, under the

Let's keep this going in sight, never an ending.  Let's remember
that this world wants fresh beginnings.  I feel here, in this

"He was polite to his elders, who disliked him.  Whatever his
elders told him to do, he did.  They told him to look before he
leaped, and he always looked before he leaped.  They told him
never to put off until the next day what he could do the day
before, and he never did.  He was told to honour his father and
his mother, and he honoured his father and his mother.  He was
told that he should not kill, and he did not kill, until he got
into the Army.  Then he was told to kill, and he killed.  He
turned the other cheek on every occasion and always did unto
others exactly as he would have had others do unto him.  When he
gave to charity, his left hand never knew what his right hand was
doing.  He never once took the name of the Lord his God in vain,
committed adultery or coveted his neighbour's ass.  In fact, he
loved his neighbour and never even bore false witness against
him.  [His] elders disliked him because he was such a flagrant
nonconformist." (Catch 22)

grieve over is not made anodyne by death.  This hole in my heart

Worse, its pacing is erratic.  Some chapters are little more than
a few sentences in length, while others stretch into volumes.

creates amazing textures, but it can't be counted on for snappy
beginnings or good endings either.  Indeed, in many cases no

"How can you worry about pleasing people [critics] and what
they're going to think?  How can you do anything creative if the
whole thing is motivated by trying to please somebody else?  To
me, the whole idea of what I thought art, or music, or anything
creative was about pleasing yourself and hoping that whatever
you're creating will reach someone else who'll see it on that
level.  To worry about someone picking it apart and discussing it
element for element, and trying to knock you down or weaken it in
any way doesn't amount to anything but a waste of paper."

something terrible, you can't punish him, because he can't help
it, because his genes or his environment or God made him do it,
and every time somebody does something good, you can't honour him
because he was a puppet, too.  If you think that everybody around
you is a puppet why bother talking to them at all?  Why even try

"A strange thing happened then.  The Speaker agreed with her that
she had made a mistake that night, and she knew when he said the
words that it was true, that his judgement was correct.  And yet
she felt strangely healed, as if simply speaking her mistake were
enough to purge some of the pain of it.  For the first time,
then, she caught a glimpse of what the power of speaking might
be.  It wasn't a matter of confession, penance, and absolution,
like the priests offered.  It was something else entirely. 
Telling the story of who she was, and then realizing that she was
no longer the same person.  That she had made a mistake, and the
mistake had changed her, and now she would not make the mistake
again because she had become someone else, someone less afraid,
someone more compassionate."

this book, you and I will meet one-on-one, my mind and yours, and
you will enter a world of my making and dwell there, not as a

people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of
honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to
appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world
a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a
redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed
easier because you have lived.  This is to have succeeded."

"Since a rational man's ambition is unlimited, since his pursuit
and achievement of values is a lifelong process -- and the higher
the values, the harder the struggle -- he needs a moment, an hour

his completed task, the sense of living in a universe where his
values have been successfully achieved.  It is like a moment of
rest, a moment to gain fuel to move farther." (Anthem)

"Most people have learned to live in the moment.  The argument
goes that if the past has uncertain effect on the present, there
is no need to dwell on the past.  And if the present has little
effect on the future, present actions need not be weighed for
their consequence.  Rather, each act is an island in time, to be
judged on its own. ... It is a world of impulse.  It is a world
of sincerity.  It is a world in which every word spoken speaks
just to that moment, every glance given has only one meaning."

"When indignation takes possession of his mind -- and it is
easily excited -- his disposition becomes malevolent.  He hates
with the bitterest contempt.  But as soon as he has indulged
those feelings, he regains the humanity which he had lost -- from
the immediate impulse of provocation -- and repents deeply.  So
that his mind is continually making the most sudden transitions -
- from good to evil, from evil to good.  A state of such
perpetual tumult must be attended with the misery of restless
inconsistency.  He laments his want of tranquillity and speaks of
the power of application to composing studies, as a blessing
placed beyond his attainment, which he regrets."

"Poetry, even that of the loftiest, and seemingly, that of the
wildest odes, [has] a logic of its own as severe as that of

great poets... there is a reason assignable, not only for every

of Crayolas.  And we wouldn't go cheap, either -- not little
boxes of eight.  Boxes of sixty-four, with the sharpener built
right in.  With silver and gold and copper, magenta and peach and

"Life has no other discipline to impose, if we would but realize

Our world suffers from terminal normality.  Take a moment to
assess all of the things around you that promote your being
'average'.  These are the things that keep you powerless to go
beyond a 'limit' you arbitrarily set for yourself.  The first

things that are limiting.  One way is to surround yourself with

you listen to the radio tonight, there was an honest, rational
desire to learn what is wrong with the world, you are the man
whom I wished to address.  By the rules and terms of my code, one

are making an effort to know.  Those who are making an effort to
fail to understand me, are not a concern of mine."  (Atlas 981)

the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal
of the lives of others.  Just as there are no contradictions in
my values and no conflicts among my desires -- so there are no

"Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal
and can have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a
value if obtained by fraud -- that an attempt to gain a value by
deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victims to
a position higher than reality, where you become a pawn of their
blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions,
while their intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness
become the enemies you have to dread and flee -- that you do not
care to live as a dependent, least of all a dependent on the
stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of values is the
fools he succeeds in fooling -- that honesty is not a social
duty, not a sacrifice for the sake of others, but the most
profoundly selfish virtue man can practice:  his refusal to
sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded
consciousness of others."  (Atlas 937)

"My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single
axiom:  existence exists -- and in a single choice:  to live. 
The rest proceeds from these.  To live, man must hold three
things as the supreme and ruling values of his life:  Reason --
Purpose -- Self-esteem.  Reason, as his only tool of knowledge --
Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must
proceed to achieve -- Self-esteem, as his inviolate certainty
that his mind is competent to think and his person is worth of
happiness, which means:  is worthy of living.  These three values
imply and require all of man's virtues, and all his virtues
pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness: 
rationality, independence, integrity, honesty, justice,
productiveness, pride."  (Atlas 936)

"You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need
no morality on a desert island -- it is on a desert island that
he would need it most.  Let him try to claim, when there are no
victims to pay for it, that a rock is a house, that sand is
clothing, that food will drop into his mouth without cause or
effort, that he will collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his
stock seed today -- and reality will wipe him out, as he
deserves; reality will show him that life is a value to be bought
and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it."

"A rational process is a moral process.  You may make an error at
any step of it, with nothing to protect you but your own
severity, or you may try to cheat, to fake the evidence and evade
the effort of the quest -- but if devotion to the truth is the
hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more
heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the
responsibility of thinking."  (Atlas 935)

"No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is your own
mind that has to acquire it.  It is only with your own knowledge
that you can deal.  It is only your own knowledge that you can
claim to possess or ask others to consider.  Your mind is your
only judge of truth -- and if others dissent from your verdict,
reality is the court of final appeal.  Nothing but a man's mind
can perform that complex, delicate, crucial process of
identification which is thinking.  Nothing can direct the process
but his own judgement.  Nothing can direct his judgement but his
moral integrity."  (Atlas 935)

"But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of
irrational whims.  Just as man is free to attempt to survive in
any random manner, but will perish unless he lives as his nature
requires, so he is free to seek his happiness in any mindless
fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he will find, unless
he seeks the happiness proper to man.  The purpose of morality is
to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and
live."  (Atlas 932)

"For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those
who claimed that your life belongs to God and those who claimed
that it belongs to your neighbours -- between those who preached
that the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven
and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the
sake of incompetents on earth.  And no one came to say that your
life belongs to you and that the good is to live it."  (Atlas

it feels like, I can't catch hold of it -- and that's path of the

virtue by practising charity with wealth which he did not own, by
giving away goods which he had not produced, by making others pay
for the luxury of his pity.  He is the man who became the symbol
of the idea that need, not achievement, is the source of rights,
that we don't have to produce, only to want, that the earned does
not belong to us, but the unearned does.  He became a

"It was his Fourth Concerto, the last work he had written.  The
crash of its opening chords swept the sights of the streets away
from her mind.  The Concerto was a great cry of rebellion.  It
was a 'NO' flung at some vast process of torture, a denial of
suffering, a denial that held the agony of the struggle to break
free.  The sounds were like a voice saying:  There is no
necessity for pain -- why, then, is the worst pain reserved for
those who will not accept its necessity?  -- we who hold the love
and the secret of joy, to what punishment have we been sentenced
for it, and by whom? ... The sounds of torture became defiance,
the statement of agony became a hymn to a distant vision for
whose sake anything was worth enduring, even this.  It was the
song of rebellion -- and of a desperate quest."  (Atlas 69)

wonderful to watch, it was the hurry of men who knew where they
were going and were eager to get there.  Now they're hurrying
because they are afraid.  It's not a purpose that drives them,
it's fear.  They're not going anywhere, they're escaping.  And I
don't think they know what it is that they want to escape.  They
don't look at one another.  They jerk when brushed against.  They
smile too much, but it's an ugly kind of smiling:  it's not joy,
it's pleading.  I don't know what it is that's happening to the
world."  (Atlas 64)

"What did they seek from him?  What were they after?  He had
never asked anything of them; it was they who wished to hold him,
they who pressed a claim on him -- and the seemed to have the
form of affection, but it was a form which he found harder to
endure than any sort of hatred.  He despised causeless affection,
just as he despised unearned wealth.  They professed to love him
for some unknown reason and they ignored all the things for which
he could wish to be loved.  He wondered what response they could
hope to obtain from him in such manner -- if his response was
what they wanted.  And it was, he though; else why those constant
complaints, those unceasing accusations about his indifference? 
Why that chronic air of suspicion, as if they were waiting to be
hurt?  He had never had a desire to hurt them, but he had always
felt their defensive, reproachful expectation; they seemed
wounded by anything he said, it was not a matter of his words or
actions, it was almost... almost as if they were wounded by the
mere fact of his being.  Don't start imagining the insane -- he
told himself severely, struggling to face the riddle with the
strictest of his ruthless sense of justice.  He could not condemn
them without understanding; and he could not understand."  (Atlas

"They did not use swords, or keep slaves.  They were not
barbarians.  I do not know the rules and laws of their society,
but I suspect that they were singularly few.  As they did without
monarchy and slavery, so they also got on without the stock
exchange, the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. 
Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk, not dulcet
shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians.  They were not less
complex than us.  The trouble is that we have a bad habit,
encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness
as something rather stupid.  Only pain is intellectual, only evil
interesting.  This is the treason of the artist:  a refusal to
admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.  If
you can't lick 'em, join 'em.  If it hurts, repeat it.  But to
praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to
lose hold of everything else.  We have almost lost hold, we can
no longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. 
How can I tell you about the people of Omelas?  They were not
naive and happy children -- though their children were, in fact
happy.  They were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose
lives were not wretched."

a person can throw a ball harder or hit it further than most
ordinary human beings, he is placed on a pedestal at an early
age.  I don't think there is anything wrong with admiring an
exceptionally skilled person, but the hero-worship we shower on
athletes goes beyond that.  This is a part of the tribal
influence handed down by our ancestors.  Man has always been
lionized for his physical prowess.  An Indian brave did not have
to pass a math quiz in order to become a chief, he just had to
tear the ass of some bear.  And the twelve labours of Hercules
did not include a Regents' exam.  Society has tended to find its
heroes in the most obvious arenas, and I don't regard that as a

"Alcohol is like anything else.  It's only as bad as the person
it's being poured into.  If it's used to heighten an occasion, or
to take an edge off stress, I don't see a problem.  Trouble
starts when you either lose control and let the bottle run you,
or when you believe its promises of immortality.  You realize
that no matter how much you punish yourself, you always seem to
wake up the next day.  Pretty soon you're convinced that you will
never die.  What that happens I guess it is time to look for help
before you life becomes one long, lost weekend."

"During those moments on the pitching rubber, when you have every
pitch at your command working to its highest potential, you are
your own universe.  For hours after the game, this sense of
completeness lingers.  Then you sink back to what we humorously
refer to as reality.  Your body aches and your muscles cry out. 
You feel your mortality.  That can be a difficult thing to
handle.  I believe pitchers come in touch with death a lot sooner
than other players.  We are more aware of the subtle changes
taking place in our body and are unable to overlook the tell-tale
hints that we are not going to last on this planet forever. 
Every pitcher has to be a little bit in love with death.  There's
a subconscious fatalism there."

was like watching a Fassbinder film, depicting mankind at its

breeding a society that lacks self-esteem.  I don't think we pat
people on the back enough, letting them know that being able to
fix a sink is just as much skill as being able to get Rod Carew
out with the bases loaded.  And more worthwhile, if you were to
ask me.  People must be made to feel their value.  Otherwise,
when they discover they can't find  any thrills in religion or in
cults, they head out to the ballpark, seeking a vicarious sense
of fulfilment.  They're tired of long-term reality; they don't
recognize what it has to offer them.  All they want is one good
fantasy.  Realizing that really shook me up."

wicked queen and rescued the prince.  That, she was learning, was
the easy part.  The hard part came when the guns were cleaned and
reholstered, the bodies of the villains cremated, and the day-to-
day business of life reared its ugly cobra's head and grinned
down at you.  When your prince had doubts you couldn't answer for
him, when you had doubts he could only shrug at, that, that was
the hard part.  That was the part the stories hadn't addressed."

"You know, everyday I get out of bed and drag myself to the next
cup of coffee.  I take a sip and the caffeine kicks in.  I can
focus my eyes again.  My brain starts to order the day.  I'm up,
I'm alive.  I'm ready to rock.  But the time is coming when I
wake up and decide that I'm not getting out of bed.  Not for
coffee, or food, or sex.  If it comes to me, fine.  If it won't,
fine.  No more expectations.  The longer I live the less I know. 
I should know more, I should know the coffee's killing me. 
You're suspicious of your suspicions?  I'm jealous.  I'm so
jealous.  You still have the heart to have doubts.  Me?  I'm

his natural life.  I got to do this.  This is my job.  This is
the deal.  This is the law.  This is my day.  I have no doubts or
suspicions about it.  Heart has nothing to do with it anymore. 
It's all in the coffee."

"I was about to tell him he was wrong to dwell on it, because it
really didn't matter.  But he cut me off and urged me one last
time, drawing himself up to his full height and asking me if I
believed in God.  I said no.  He sat down indignantly.  He said
it was impossible; all men believed in God, even those who turn
their backs on him.  That was his belief, and if he were ever to
doubt it, his life would become meaningless. 'Do you want my life
to be meaningless?' he shouted.  As far as I could see, it didn't
have anything to do with me, and I told him so.  But from across
the table he had already thrust the crucifix in my face was
screaming irrationally, 'I am a Christian.  I ask Him to forgive
you for sins. How can you not believe that He suffered for you?' 
I was struck by how sincere he seemed, but I had had enough.  It
was getting hotter and hotter.  As always, whenever I want to get
rid of  someone I'm not really listening to, I made it appear as
if I agreed.  To my surprise, he acted triumphant.  'You see, you
see!' he said.  'You do believe, don't you, and you're going to
place your trust in Him, aren't you?'   Obviously, I again said
no.  He fell back in his chair"

 Making the mastodon breath,
 Making the hunters race and kill.

 Watch them seeking to placate and understand the world above
 This they know.
 This they understand.
 There is darkness, everywhere, outside.

 The dark is everywhere; and though the sun comes up,
 And though the fires blossom and are tamed,
 The darkness is there,
 The darkness is waiting.

 As the things in the darkness
 That whisper before they feast,
 They are to be placated and persuaded,
 They are to be loved and sacrificed to,
 They are to be prayed to and distrusted.

 And so there is magic."

sides of a fight, and a whole lot safer.  Friends can betray you.

happened, you could handle it.  You thought that you were in
control.  You thought wrong.  Now you've lost it all.  She's
gone.  All that's left is the numbing pain.  You have to let go
to stop the pain, but you can't.  It's like a drug to you now. 
You don't want to need it, but it has become a part of you, and
it won't loosen its grip on you.  The control you once fought
for, is gone.  You have no control.  And you just don't care."

plastic on the floor was arranged so that none of the blood
stained the lily white carpet.  They discovered the child hunched
down in a closet covered in her own waste, the tears dried away,
the hollow eyes looking out at nothing.

They say not to go into the Fifth Street alley at night -- it's
just not safe.  They say that the library is haunted -- that
sometimes you can feel the crinkle of plastic under your feet.

with her full face shining night long like torchlight luring in a
graveyard.  She glows as when magicians spells torment her reins
taught.  She holds course, hogging the horizon moon.  Now your
fire has hues of deathly pallor.  Pour waves of grim light on the
winds to frighten mankind.

On grass red with bloodstains, I offer your beasts ritually
butchered for you a fire torch snatched from a cremation burns in
the night; for you I arch and toss back my head.  I sing, I loose
my hair, then bind it with sacred headband, and they do at
funerals.  For you I grip this bough shrivelled with deaths dew. 
For you I bare my breast, slice into my arms with holy knife,
shed my sanity and blood forever."

"Death is but a stepping over, a passage through the Shroud.  The
moment of death is a rite of passage marking the end of one
journey and the beginning of another, a path available to us at
any time.

The thousands of things undone, the millions of roads not
travelled, the longings and regrets; they do not die with the
body.  Instead they linger on and take a life of their own.  They
become ghosts.  They become shadows.

Trapped between this world and the next, wraiths are lost in the
immortal gloom of damnation.  Held together out of pure misery,
they are trapped by their past, their longings and their fear. 
Many are the products of sudden, violent or cruel deaths.  They
are bound by a sense of crucial deeds undone, of unsaid words
breaking in their hearts, of a life cut short by Fate.  Others
are consumed by a tragic longing for happiness and fulfilment
denied them in life.  A few are driven by bitterness, anger or
passionate ideals."

 I can't even touch the books you've read
 I followed you beneath the stars
 Hounded by your memory
 And all your raging glory
 But now I'm finally free
 I kiss good-bye the howling beast
 That separated you from me
 You'll never know the hurt I suffered
 Nor the pain I rise above
 And I'll never know the same about you,
 But soon we'll be together
 In the clasp of oblivion."

"The conquest of the fear of death is the recovery of life's joy. 
One can experience an unconditional affirmation of life only when
one has accepted death, not as contrary to life, but as an aspect
of life.  Life in its becoming is always shedding death, and on
the point of death.  The conquest of fear yields the courage of
life.  That is the cardinal initiation of every heroic adventure
-- fearlessness and achievement."

"With each passing day oblivion encroaches further.  With every
soul that surrenders to shadow, the end draws nearer.  The world
is not as we knew it, decay's sweet stench now clings to all we
once held dear.  It is called the Shadowlands.  In death there is
nowhere to hide, nowhere to run, from the hate and fear, the pain
and bitterness, the shadow within.  Hope is fragile and few have
the courage, the passion, to face death, and say, 'I do not go
gentle into that good night.'"

"Humans suffer from self-centred notions as to the nature of
life.  Humans assume that alien life forms should conform to
standards that match our own, including logic and morality.  Even
among humans, morality is ignored when expedient.  Why should we
expect more from an alien life form than we demand from
ourselves?"

away.  There was only her self, the centre that endured through

"No, now he didn't want to let himself get too close because he
knew it wasn't going to last.  Good stuff never lasted.  Change
would come and wipe it away, and what was the point?  It hurt too
much every time it was ripped away and he was getting tired of
losing pieces of himself.  Pretty soon there wouldn't be much
left, just scraps of gristle and bone without feeling.  He didn't
need that."

"Well.  There was noting to be done for it.  Things had happened
as they did, time's arrow had yet to be reversed by humans, done
was done.  If a man spent his life looking over his shoulder at
every possible branching of his path he could have taken, he
would never accomplish anything.  One must learn from history so
as not to repeat it, but one must not waste one's energy or time
worrying about what might have been.  Sorry... but people die
every day and the galaxy continues on quite welm\l without them.

"Evil is... a moral entity and not a created one, an eternal and

"Artists use frauds to make human beings seem more wonderful than
they really are. Dancers show us human beings who move much more
gracefully than human beings really move. Films and books and
plays show us people talking much more entertainingly than people
really talk, make paltry human enterprises seem important.
Singers and musicians show us human beings making sounds far more
lovely than human beings really make. Architects give us temples
in which something marvellous is obviously going on. Actually,
practically nothing is going on."

"Now blessings light on him that first invented this same sleep:
it covers a man all over, thoughts and all, like a cloak;  'tis
meat for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, heat for the cold,
and cold for the hot.  'Tis the current coin that purchases all
the pleasures of the world cheap; and the balance that sets the
king and the shepherd, the fool and the wise-man even. There is
only one thing, that I dislike in sleep;  'tis that it resembles
death; there's very little difference between a man in his first
sleep, and a man in his last sleep."

"Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or
reflection:  the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to

living each day in grief."

"Melancholy is at the bottom of everything, just as at the end of
all rivers is the sea. Can it be otherwise in a world where
nothing lasts, where all that we have loved or shall love must
die?  Is death, then, the secret of life?  The gloom of an
eternal mourning enwraps, more or less closely, every serious and
thoughtful soul, as night enwraps the universe."

"A bestial and violent man will go so far as to kill because he
is under the influence of drink, exasperated, or driven by rage

killing, the charity of bestowing death like a caress, of linking
it with the play of the noble wild beasts:  every cat, every
tiger, embraces its prey and licks it even while it destroys it."

the delicious thrill of hiding while the others come looking for

hide too well. You mustn't be too good at the game. The player

"The timidity of the child or the savage is entirely reasonable;
they are alarmed at this world, because this world is a very
